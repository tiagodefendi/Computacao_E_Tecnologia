# Individual Activity on *Computer Languages*.

In this laboratory, we were asked to write two basic programs in different programming languages. The professor requested to choose three languages on the website: [Hello World Collection](http://helloworldcollection.de/), and execute the following commands:

1. Choose one **procedural language**, one **object-oriented language**, and one **functional language**. Markup languages (such as HTML) will not be considered.

2. Choose programming languages that are currently unknown to you.

3. Throughout the course, you will already have contact with the languages C, C++, Python, Java, and Javascript. Therefore, choose languages different from these five.

3. For each chosen language, write two programs:

    * HelloWorld - A program that prints "Hello World" on the screen.

    * SumNumbers - A program that reads two numbers from the user and prints the sum of these numbers on the screen.
